# Smart Gripper
*Project for HackGT 4*

A smart prosthetic hand that uses object recognition, vision processing, 
and sensor feedback to grasp at commonly used objects.

* __vision__ contains an overarching script for the system that 
  * retrieves and packages frames, 
  * sends them to the cloud where object recognition is performed, 
  * checks the relative object position and distance, and
  * commands the gripping motion
